### A simple example of Cross-site request forgery attack using PHP

## File Descriptions:
# WebApp with xsrf-vulnerability:
#   - index.php, content.php, logout.php
# Malicious Website/link:
#   - mal.php

## In order for the attack to be successful, there must be some requirement:
# - The victim (user) must be logged in and active on the target website
# - The victim is tricked to visit a page created by attacker.

## Preventing against XSRF:
# Using secret token:
# To protect against the attack above, we need to make sure that the request sent
# to server is actually sent by the real user. In other words, we need to
# authenticate the user. We can archive authentication by sending a token along
# with the request. In order for the token to be secret, it should be randomized
# when user logs into the system and send with it  in every message.

$_SESSION['csrf_token'] = randomize_token();
echo "<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="<?php echo $_SESSION['csrf_token']; ?>">"

function randomize_token() {
//Create token here
}

### EXERCISE:
### How to secure the logout function?

# By dynamically randomization of the token, we can also avoid the brute force
# attack on the token. We can also encrypt the token before sending request
# in order to protect the token from being sniffed by attacker.

# Another trick that can limit attackerâ€™s probability of successful is to ask
# for CAPTCHA or to ask for user to re-log in before a important action. It is a
# little bit annoying when we have to log in for each 20 minutes but it is worth
# considering when you are managing a banking system or action such as changing
# password.
